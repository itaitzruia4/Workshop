1. Each store contains a founderID field. 
Upon a manager request for store role members, we can obtain the founderID from the store,
then reach the founder User instance with UserController.users dictionary (key=user id), 
then recursively search the members field

b. Using data class
c. Inheritance like SPL assignment 3
